# ChronoSim

[ChronoSim](https://github.com/adolgert/ChronoSim.jl) is a stochastic discrete event simulation framework that automatically tracks and manages complex interdependencies between events and state changes for high-performance scientific computing applications.

 * Exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) for time-varying hazard rates.
 * Rule-based event generation.
 * Fine-grained coupling between state and events makes it easier to combine interacting behaviors in the same simulation.
 * Scientific computing focus.
